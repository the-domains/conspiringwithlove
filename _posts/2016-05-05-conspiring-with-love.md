# Conspiring with LOVE

to breathe with the Spirit and surrender to love

**_a funeral welcome... _**

# _Infinite, unfailing LOVE fills this space. _

__

_Welcoming us _

__

_In the midst of our deep, aching grief_

__

_In our tears and cherished memories_

__

_In our sadness, longing, unanswered questions _

__

_Offering hope and peace to our broken hearts._

__

_Fierce, unfaltering LOVE is here_

__

_When we are at a loss for words_

__

_When we can only hug, or sigh, or kneel, or weep._

__

_When we draw our first breath and when we exhale our last_

__

_When we realize life is fragile, oh so, precious and shared_

__

_The source of LOVE is here. _

__

_Drawing_

__

_close _

__

_to us,_

__

_closer to us than the air we even breathe._

__

_Courageous, vulnerable LOVE communes with us._

__

_As we say we say our loved ones name_

__

_As we remember LOVE gave them the SPARK of life,_

__

_LOVE consumed their days and _

__

_LOVE shaped their relationships and _

__

_LOVE flowed in and through every day of their life. _

__

_And this LOVE, this fierce, unfailing, unfaltering,_

__

_courageous and vulnerable LOVE _

__

_Welcomes us and holds us in this holy good-bye._
