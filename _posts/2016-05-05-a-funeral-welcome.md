# a funeral welcome 

__

_Infinite, unfailing LOVE fills this space. _

__

_Welcoming us _

__

_In the midst of our deep, aching grief_

__

_In our tears and cherished memories_

__

_In our sadness, longing, unanswered questions _

__

_Offering hope and peace to our broken hearts._

__

_Fierce, unfaltering LOVE is here_

__

_When we are at a loss for words_

__

_When we can only hug, or sigh, or kneel, or weep._

__

_When we draw our first breath and when we exhale our last_

__

_When we realize life is fragile, oh so, precious and shared_

__

_The source of LOVE is here. _

__

_Drawing_

__

_close _

__

_to us,_

__

_closer to us than the air we even breathe._

__

_Courageous, vulnerable LOVE communes with us._

__

_As we say (our loves name) remember him/her as a beloved _

__

_son/daughter, sister/brother, mother/father, and dear friend. _

__

_As we remember LOVE gave her the SPARK of life,_

__

_LOVE consumed (his/her) days and _

__

_LOVE shaped (her/his) relationships and _

__

_LOVE flowed in and through every day of (their) life. _

__

_And this LOVE, this fierce, unfailing, unfaltering,_

__

_courageous and vulnerable LOVE _

__

_Welcomes us and holds us in this time of holy good-bye._
