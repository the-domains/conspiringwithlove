this is my image of God 

Rubev's "Trinity" from 1425

the Holy Community are at a table together 

heads tilted to listen and love 

the Father on the left shares his power 

the Son sits in the middle 

the Spirit, dressed in sky blue, gazes at both

the communion of LOVE makes them ONE

and the mystery of this icon? 

there is room for you and me at the table too.
